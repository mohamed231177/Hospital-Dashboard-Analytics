# Hospital-Dashboard-Analytics
An interactive Power BI dashboard designed for "Liceria & Co." to monitor hospital branches, financial performance, and medical staff efficiency.

##  Questions (KPIs)
- What is the total revenue ($544M) and the volume of bills ($10M) generated across all branches?
- What is the gender distribution among our 1,000 patients?
- Which payment methods (Credit Card, Insurance, Cash, Online) are most preferred by patients?
- Which medical specialties (Cardiology, Neurology, etc.) have the most experienced doctors on staff?

## process

- Data Integration: How were diverse datasets (Patient records, Payroll, Billing) merged into a unified model?

- Geographic Analysis: How were branch-specific filters (Alexandria, Aswan, Cairo, Giza, Mansoura) implemented for localized insights?

- HR Analytics: How were salary distributions and staff counts calculated using DAX measures?

- Advanced Visuals: Why were TreeMaps used for staff counts and Donut charts for shift distributions?

- Interactive Slicers: How were specialty and shift slicers integrated to allow deep-dives into departmental performance?
